# Statistical Calculations Project

## Overview
This project successfully implements statistical calculations, including:

- Average
- Median
- Variance
- Standard Deviation

## Usage
The program reads numerical data from a file and computes the required statistical values. The input file should contain one numerical value per line, representing a statistical population.

### Example Input File
```
189
113
121
114
145
110
...
```

### Running the Program
```
$> make 
$> ./math-skills data.txt
```

### Output Format
The program processes the input file and prints the results in the following format:
```
Average: 35
Median: 4
Variance: 5
Standard Deviation: 65
```
**Note:** The values are rounded integers.

## Testing and Validation
The program was tested using various datasets, including randomly generated numbers. The results were validated by comparing outputs against expected values calculated through independent means.

## Learnings and Outcomes
Through this project, the following key concepts were reinforced:

- Statistical and mathematical computations
- Efficient file handling and data processing
- Implementing algorithms for:
  - Average
  - Median
  - Variance
  - Standard Deviation

## Conclusion
This project successfully achieved its objectives by accurately computing statistical values from input data. It provides a fundamental understanding of statistical measures and their practical applications.
